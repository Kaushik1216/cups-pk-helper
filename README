cups-pk-helper
==============

cups-pk-helper is a PolicyKit helper to configure cups with fine-grained
privileges.

For example, it's possible to let users enable/disable printers without
requiring a password, while still requiring a password for editing printer
settings. The full list of policies is described in
src/org.opensuse.cupspkhelper.mechanism.policy.in.
